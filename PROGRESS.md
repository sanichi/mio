# Session Summary: Subscription Feature Development

## What We Built:

### Database & Migration:
- Created `create_subscriptions` migration with `frequency` as TINYINT with `default: 0, limit: 1`
- Table includes: payee, amount, frequency, source, timestamps

### Subscription Model (`app/models/subscription.rb`):
- Added Constrainable and Pageable modules
- Enum: `frequency: { monthly: 0, weekly: 1, daily: 2, annually: 3 }` (monthly as default)
- Constants: `MAX_PAYEE = 30`, `MAX_SOURCE = 20`
- Validations: amount (positive integer), payee/source (presence + length)
- `canonicalize` method for whitespace cleanup on payee/source
- `human_frequency` method for I18n translations
- `search` class method for payee/source fields

### Controller (`app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb`):
- Full CRUD controller following classifiers_controller pattern
- Uses `Subscription.search(params)` in index
- Proper strong params for all subscription attributes

### Configuration:
- Routes: Added `resources :subscriptions` (alphabetically ordered)
- Translations (`config/locales/subscription.yml`): enum values + page titles
- Factory (`spec/factories/subscriptions.rb`): Realistic test data

### Testing Setup:
- FactoryBot factory ready for testing

### Views (`app/views/subscriptions/`):
- `index.html.haml`: Search form with frequency filter, table showing payee/amount/frequency/source
- `_subscription.html.haml`: Table row partial with formatted amount using `sub_format_amount`
- `_form.html.haml`: Form with payee, amount, frequency dropdown, source fields
- `show.html.haml`: Detailed view showing all subscription fields with formatted amount
- `new.html.haml` & `edit.html.haml`: Standard new/edit pages

### Helper (`app/helpers/subscription_helper.rb`):
- `sub_format_amount` method: Converts integer pennies to formatted pounds (123 → £1.23)

### Updated Configuration:
- Added "new" and "edit" translation keys to `config/locales/subscription.yml`
- Removed `Pageable` module from model (no pagination needed)
- Added navigation link to `app/views/layouts/_nav.html.haml` in "other" section

### Amount Formatting:
- Added `amount=` setter method in model to convert string input (e.g. "£5.10") to integer pennies (510)
- Uses `value` parameter in Rails text_field for proper form display of formatted amounts
- Added uniqueness validation to payee field

## Migration Applied:
✅ Database table created and ready

## Current Status:
✅ **Feature Complete**: Backend, views, navigation, and amount formatting all working

## Next Steps:
- Integration/feature specs
- Any additional styling/UX improvements

## How to Continue Development:
1. Switch to the feature branch: `git checkout subscriptions`
2. Reference this `PROGRESS.md` file to see what we accomplished
3. Continue building the views and any remaining features
4. Eventually merge back to main when ready
