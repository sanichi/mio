I'll analyze your Ruby on Rails project to provide feedback. Let me examine the codebase structure and key files.

Based on my analysis of your Rails project, here are my observations and feedback:

## **Positives:**

- **Modern Rails 8**: Up-to-date with Rails 8.0.2.1
- **Good test coverage**: 58 spec files with RSpec, FactoryBot, and feature tests
- **Security conscious**: Using CanCanCan for authorization, session management, 2FA/OTP
- **Well-structured**: Clear separation of concerns with proper MVC patterns
- **Comprehensive features**: Multi-domain app covering various functionality
- **Secure password handling**: Uses bcrypt for password hashing (resolved previous MD5 security issue)
- **Clean validations**: Appropriate use of `with_options` to reduce repetition where beneficial

## **Areas for improvement:**

### **Code Quality:**
1. **Complex routes file**: 77 lines with mixed concerns - consider extracting namespaced routes into separate files

2. **Large migration count**: 300+ migrations suggests the schema has evolved significantly - consider consolidating older migrations

### **Testing:**
3. **Disabled transactional fixtures** (`rails_helper.rb:40`) without clear justification - this can slow tests and cause flaky behavior

### **Documentation:**
4. **Minimal README**: Could benefit from:
   - Feature overview
   - Architecture decisions
   - Development workflow
   - Deployment instructions

### **Dependencies:**
5. **Version constraints**: Some gems lack upper bounds (e.g., `pg`) which could cause future compatibility issues

The codebase shows excellent Rails conventions and has addressed previous security concerns. The remaining issues are primarily organizational and documentation-related rather than critical security problems.
