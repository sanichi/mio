I'll analyze your Ruby on Rails project to provide feedback. Let me examine the codebase structure and key files.

Based on my analysis of your Rails project, here are my observations and feedback:

## **Positives:**

- **Modern Rails 8**: Up-to-date with Rails 8.0.2.1
- **Good test coverage**: 58 spec files with RSpec, FactoryBot, and feature tests
- **Security conscious**: Using CanCanCan for authorization, session management, 2FA/OTP
- **Well-structured**: Clear separation of concerns with proper MVC patterns
- **Comprehensive features**: Multi-domain app covering various functionality

## **Areas for improvement:**

### **Security Concerns:**
1. **MD5 password hashing** (`user.rb:37`) - MD5 is cryptographically broken. Use bcrypt instead:
   ```ruby
   has_secure_password # Rails built-in with bcrypt
   ```

2. **Hardcoded OTP secret** in production code (`user.rb:11`) - Move to credentials or environment variables

### **Code Quality:**
3. **Typo in method name** (`application_controller.rb:5`): `remember_last_non_autenticated_path` â†’ `remember_last_non_authenticated_path`

4. **Complex routes file**: 77 lines with mixed concerns - consider extracting namespaced routes into separate files

5. **Large migration count**: 300+ migrations suggests the schema has evolved significantly - consider consolidating older migrations

### **Testing:**
6. **Disabled transactional fixtures** (`rails_helper.rb:40`) without clear justification - this can slow tests and cause flaky behavior

### **Documentation:**
7. **Minimal README**: Could benefit from:
   - Feature overview
   - Architecture decisions
   - Development workflow
   - Deployment instructions

### **Dependencies:**
8. **Version constraints**: Some gems lack upper bounds (e.g., `pg`) which could cause future compatibility issues

The codebase shows good Rails conventions overall, but the MD5 password hashing is a critical security issue that should be addressed immediately.
