  How to Search and View Pictures

      = succeed(":") do
        %strong= t("name")
      You can search for pictures using one or more terms to match the first, last or "known as"
      names of the people associated with each picture. Terms are case insensitive, don't have to
      be full names and order is not important. For example, a fairly specific search might be:
      %em "john smith"
      which would only find pictures linked to people who had names matching both those terms.
      In contrast, a less specific search example is:
      %em "jo sm"
      which would match pictures associated with John Smith but also Joe Smyth, Jo Dinsmore, and so on.
    %li
      = succeed(":") do
        %strong= t("description")
      Some pictures have descriptions and you can search for matching terms in those descriptions
      such as place names, years or the names of people in the picture other than the main person
      linked to it (see above). Enter one or more case-insensitive terms (not necessarily full words)
      to match on. Only pictures with descriptions matching all terms will be in the results.
      An example of a search term that works well with image descriptions is:
      = succeed(".") do
        %em "wedding"
    %li
      = succeed(":") do
        %strong= t("view")
      To view the full size version of any picture (along side it's description and a list of
      people associated with it) just click on it.
